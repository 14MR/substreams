# Definition

### What is Substreams?

Substreams is an exceptionally powerful processing engine capable of consuming streams of rich blockchain data. Substreams refines and shapes the data for painless digestion by end-user applications, such as decentralized exchanges.

### Benefits of Substreams

* **Store & Process Blockchain Data**\
  Substreams can be used to populate any kind of data store and also employs extremely powerful parallelization techniques to process huge, and ever-growing, blockchain histories.
* **Save Time & Money**\
  Substreams can be scaled horizontally resulting in a massive reduction of processing time, and ultimately cost, through the addition of multiple machines.
* **Community Effort**\
  Communities can combine Substreams data refinement strategies to form compounding levels of data richness and availability.
* **Brand New Web3 Concepts**\
  Substreams brings a handful of new concepts to the wider ecosystem surrounding The Graph and its subgraphs.&#x20;
* **Deep & Wide Blockchain Search**\
  Subgraphs require one or more smart contract addresses to collect data to query. Substreams donâ€™t require _ANY_ contract addresses and the _**entire chain** with history_ is available to query.
* **Blockchain Infused Large-scale Data**\
  Substreams was inspired by traditional large-scale data systems now _fused_ with the novelties of blockchain.
* **Rust & Protobufs**\
  Substreams are defined in modules written in the Rust programming language and utilize Google Protocol Buffer technology.
* **Reduced Archive Node Reliance**\
  Substreams results in reduced reliance on archive nodes!

### Capabilities of Substreams

#### _Substreams **is:**_

* a streaming-first system based on gRPC, protobuf, and StreamingFast Firehose,
* a highly cacheable and parallelizable remote code execution framework,&#x20;
* composable down to individual modules,
* enables the community to build higher-order modules with great ease,
* being fed by deterministic blockchain data and is therefor deterministic.

### Limitations of Substreams

#### _Substreams is **NOT:**_

* a relational database,
* REST service,
* concerned directly with how data is stored,
* a general-purpose _non-deterministic_ event stream processor.

### **Substreams Deep Dive**

Substreams enables blockchain developers to write Rust modules that compose data streams alongside the community. The end result of community-developed solutions provides far more meaningful blockchain data than ever before.

#### Parallelization

Substreams provides extremely high-performance indexing by virtue of parallelization, in a streaming-first fashion. These powerful parallelization techniques enable efficient processing of enormous blockchain histories.

#### Horizontally Scalable&#x20;

Substreams is horizontally scalable presenting the opportunity to reduce processing time simply by adding more computing power, or machines.

#### Substreams & Firehose

Substreams has all the benefits of Firehose, like low-cost caching and archiving of blockchain data, high throughput processing, and cursor-based reorgs handling.

The Substreams _engine_ is completely agnostic of underlying blockchain protocols and works solely on data extracted from nodes using the Firehose.&#x20;

Different protocols have different chain-specific extensions, such as Ethereum, which expose `eth_calls`.

#### Substreams & Sparkle

Substreams is the successor of [StreamingFast Sparkle](https://github.com/streamingfast/sparkle). The current Substreams iteration enables greater composability, provides similar powers of parallelization. Basically, Substreams is a _much_ simpler model to work with.

#### Quick Facts

The _word_ Substreams refers to:

* a wink to Subgraphs,
* a plurality of _streams_, each in the form of a _module,_
* packed in a single package, but streamable individually a _sub_unit of a package,
* _streams_ composed from imported modules, blended, enriched or refined together (as in _sub_ or downstream component),
* a manifest or package will usually contain more than one module, and/or import one or more modules. It is therefore fitting to talk about a package being a _Substreams_ package.
