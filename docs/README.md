# ðŸ”€ Substreams

### Where to Start

Substreams is a new technology developed by StreamingFast working with [The Graph Foundation](https://thegraph.com/). The product provides extremely fast consumption and processing of indexed blockchain data.

Learning more about [what Substreams is](concepts/definition.md), studying the [conceptual diagram](concept-and-fundamentals/visual-diagram.md), and then reading through the [fundamentals](concept-and-fundamentals/fundamentals.md) is a great track for learning more.

For developers looking to get started right away, first [install the CLI tool](getting-started/installing-the-cli.md) and then [start streaming](getting-started/your-first-stream.md) with Substreams.

Additional information is available for understanding [modules](concepts/modules.md), and sample code with explanations can be found in the [Developer Guide](developer-guide/overview.md) to further explore actual Substreams implementations.&#x20;

Finally, visit the [Substreams Template](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-template) repository and [Substreams Playground](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-playground) to get up and running quickly creating your very own blockchain data streaming solution.

#### Introduction Video

For a detailed walk-through of Substreams check out the video, created by StreamingFast's Alexandre Bourget.&#x20;

The introduction video will help new Substreams users gain an understanding to provide a deeper context of the different parts and pieces that comprise the technology.
