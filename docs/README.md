# Substreams

## Welcome to Substreams Documentation

Substreams is a powerful blockchain indexing technology, developed for [The Graph Network](https://thegraph.com).

Substreams enables developers to write Rust modules, composing data streams alongside the community, and provides extremely high-performance indexing by virtue of parallelization, in a streaming-first fashion.

Substreams have all the benefits of StreamingFast Firehose, like low-cost caching and archiving of blockchain data, high throughput processing, and cursor-based reorgs handling.

### Where to start

Learn about Substreams in a short, dense 25-minute intro and understand its impact on the blockchain ecosystem.

Learn important facts about Substreams by [reading the Benefits and comparison](concept-and-fundamentals/benefits/).

The primary ways to use Substreams include:

* [Installing the `substreams` CLI](getting-started/installing-the-cli.md).
* [Going through the Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart.md).

After installing Substreams and reviewing the Quickstart:

* You can [learn more about modules](concepts-and-fundamentals/modules.md), and then [study the Developer's guide](developers-guide/overview.md).

Find pre-built Substreams by using the following resources:

* [Substreams Template](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-template) - gets you off the ground.
* [Substreams Playground](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-playground) - a collection of Substreams modules, and examples.

**You can view Substreams from two perspectives** as illustrated in the high-level visual diagram. It can be viewed through the perspective of the **Substreams engine** itself and also the perspective of the **end-user developer and consumer**.
