# Substreams

### Welcome to Substreams Documentation

Substreams is a powerful blockchain indexing technology, developed for [The Graph Network](https://thegraph.com).

Substreams enables developers to write Rust modules, composing data streams alongside the community, and provides extremely high-performance indexing by virtue of parallelization, in a streaming-first fashion.

Substreams have all the benefits of StreamingFast Firehose, like low-cost caching and archiving of blockchain data, high throughput processing, and cursor-based reorgs handling.

### Where to start

A short, dense 25-minute intro to Substreams, and what it means for the blockchain ecosystem:

Read about Substreams' [Benefits and comparison](concept-and-fundamentals/benefits/).

Get started by:

* [Installing the `substreams` CLI](getting-started/installing-the-cli.md).
* Going through the [Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart.md).

Learn more about [modules](concepts-and-fundamentals/modules.md), or head into the [Developer's Guide](developers-guide/overview.md).

Find pre-built Substreams here:

* [Substreams template](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-template): gets you off the ground.
* [Substreams playground](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-playground): a collection of already-built Substreams, and examples.

Substreams can be viewed from two perspectives as illustrated in the high-level visual diagram:

1. The Substreams engine perspective.
2. The end-user developer and consumer perspective.
