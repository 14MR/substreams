# Substreams

### Welcome to Substreams Docs

Substreams is a new technology developed by StreamingFast working with [The Graph Foundation](https://thegraph.com/). The product provides extremely fast consumption and processing of indexed blockchain data.

This documentation serves as the main resource for understanding and working with StreamingFast Substreams.

### Where to Start

The best places to begin the journey are to watch the [introduction video](concept-and-fundamentals/introduction-video.md), read more about [what Substreams is](concepts/definition.md), study the [conceptual diagram](concept-and-fundamentals/visual-diagram.md), and then read through some [fundamentals](concept-and-fundamentals/fundamentals.md).

For developers looking to get started right away, first [install the CLI tool](getting-started/installing-the-cli.md) and then [start streaming](getting-started/your-first-stream.md) with Substreams.

Additional information is available for understanding [modules](concepts/modules.md), and sample code with explanations can be found in the [Developer Guide](developer-guide/overview.md) to further explore actual Substreams implementations.&#x20;

Finally, visit the [Substreams Template](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-template) repository and [Substreams Playground](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-playground) to get up and running quickly creating your very own blockchain data streaming solution.
