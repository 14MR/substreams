# Substreams

### Welcome to Substreams Docs

Substreams is a powerful blockchain indexing technology, developed for [The Graph Network](https://thegraph.com).

Substreams enables developers to write Rust modules, composing data streams alongside the community, and provides extremely high performance indexing by virtue of parallelization, in a streaming-first fashion.

Substreams have all the benefits of StreamingFast Firehose, like low-cost caching and archiving of blockchain data, high throughput processing, and cursor-based reorgs handling.

### Where to Start

A short, dense 25 minutes intro to Substreams, and what it means for the blockchain ecosystem:

Read about Substreams' [Benefits and Comparison](concept-and-fundamentals/benefits/).

Get started quickly by:

* [Installing the `substreams` CLI](getting-started/installing-the-cli.md)
* Going through the [Quick Start](getting-started/chain-agnostic-tutorial.md)

Learn more about [Modules](concept-and-fundamentals/modules.md), or head into the [Developer Guide](developer-guide/overview.md).

Find pre-built Substreams here:
