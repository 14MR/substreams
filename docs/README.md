This documentation exists as a means to help people understand and operate Substreams created by StreamingFast.

Substreams is an open-source community effort, so feel free to suggest new topics, report issues, and provide feedback wherever it could be helpful. Please contribute through GitHub [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

### Developer Preview

Substreams is a powerful blockchain indexing technology developed for [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) Network.

_**Substreams**_:&#x20;

* enables blockchain developers to write Rust modules that compose data streams alongside the community,
* provides extremely high-performance indexing by virtue of parallelization, in a streaming-first fashion,
* has all the benefits of the Firehose, like low-cost caching and archiving of blockchain data, high throughput processing, and cursor-based reorgs handling,
* is the successor of [StreamingFast Sparkle](https://github.com/streamingfast/sparkle). This iteration of the application enables greater composability, provides similar powers of parallelization, and is a much simpler model to work with.

### Getting Started

[Install the CLI](getting-started/installing-the-cli.md) and then [run your first stream](getting-started/your-first-stream.md).
