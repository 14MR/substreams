# Prerequisites

**Essential Knowledge**

Substreams can be used by blockchain, subgraph, Rust, JavaScript, and other types of developers.

Working with Substreams requires a myriad of knowledge, skills, and tools including:

[Git](https://git-scm.com/),

[YAML](https://yaml.org/),

[Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers),

Substreams CLI,

Substreams engine,

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),

and potentially [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/) solutions.

**Note**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and other backend knowledge may also be required when working with different sink types for Substreams.

In addition, developers are required to obtain a StreamingFast authentication token. The StreamingFast test endpoint servers require authentication when connecting to them to process Substreams requests.
