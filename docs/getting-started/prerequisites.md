# Prerequisites

**Technologies Used**

Substreams can be used by blockchain, subgraph, Rust, JavaScript, Python, and other types of developers.

Substreams uses a myriad of technologies including:

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
* [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
* [Buf](https://buf.build/)
* [YAML](https://yaml.org/)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and other backend knowledge may also be required when working with different sink types for Substreams.

In addition, developers are required to obtain a StreamingFast [authentication token](../reference-and-specs/authentication.md). The StreamingFast endpoint servers require authentication when connecting to them to process Substreams requests.
