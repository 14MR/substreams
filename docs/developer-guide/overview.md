# Overview

### Build a Substream

This guide explains the process of building a Substream that tracks the ERC721 holder count for a given contract.

The accompanying Substreams template repository is located on Github. [https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-template](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-template)

### Developer Guide

The Substreams developer guide is broken down into the following steps.

1. [Installation](installation-requirements.md): Install all the dependencies and set up the environment to create the first Substream.
2. [Creating Your Manifest](creating-your-manifest.md): Setup the first `substreams.yaml` which provides a high-level overview of the file.
3. [Creating Protobuf Schemas](creating-protobuf-schemas.md): Write the first Protobuf schema that will be used in the handlers.
4. [Writing Module Handlers](writing-module-handlers.md): Write the first module handler.
5. [Running your Substreams](running-substreams.md): Run the newly written Substreams
