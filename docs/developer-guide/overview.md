# Overview

### Developer Guide

This guide explains the process of building a Substream that tracks the ERC721 holder count for a given contract.

The Substreams developer guide is broken down into the following sections.

[Installation](installation-requirements.md): Install all the dependencies and set up the environment to create the first Substream.

[Creating a Manifest](creating-your-manifest.md): Setup the first `substreams.yaml` which provides a high-level overview of the project.

[Creating Protobuf Schemas](creating-protobuf-schemas.md): Write the first Protobuf schema that will be used in the handlers.

[Writing Module Handlers](writing-module-handlers.md): Write the first module handler.

[Running Substreams](running-substreams.md): Run the newly written Substreams

The accompanying [Substreams template repository](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-template) is located on Github.&#x20;
