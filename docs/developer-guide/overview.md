# Overview

### Developer Guide

The Substreams Developer Guide explains the process of building a Substream that tracks the ERC721 holder count for a given contract.

The Substreams developer guide is broken down into the following sections.

Install the dependencies and set up the environment to work with Substreams in [Dependency Installation](installation-requirements.md).

Create the manifest needed for defining locations and files required for running Substreams in [Manifest Creation](creating-your-manifest.md).

Write the protobuf schemas that will be used in conjunction with the module handlers in [Protobuf Schemas](creating-protobuf-schemas.md).

Write the module handlers in [Writing Module Handlers](writing-module-handlers.md).

Run the newly written Substreams in [Running Substreams](running-substreams.md).

Find the accompanying Substreams template source code[ ](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-template)conveniently located its [official Github repository](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-template).&#x20;
