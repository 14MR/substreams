# Overview

### Developer Guide

The Substreams Developer Guide explains the process of building a Substream that tracks the ERC721 holder count for a given contract.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip**_:_ The Substreams developer guide is currently focused on an Ethereum Substreams implementation. The majority of the development tasks and workflow are agnostic to each blockchain being targeted by the developer.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Example Substreams implementations for [Solana](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-playground/tree/master/modules/sol-spl-tokens), Aptos, and other chains are available for reference and study.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you haven't done so already, reviewing the Substreams [fundamentals](../concept-and-fundamentals/fundamentals.md) and [modules overview](../concepts/modules.md) is helpful for getting up and running with Substreams.
