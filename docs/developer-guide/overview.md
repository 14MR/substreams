# Overview

### Developer Guide

The Substreams Developer Guide explains the process of building a Substream that tracks the ERC721 holder count for a given contract.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip**_:_ The Substreams developer guide is Ethereum centric, but example Substreams implementations for [Solana](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-playground/tree/master/modules/sol-spl-tokens), Aptos, and other chains are available.&#x20;

The majority of the developer flow is agnostic to the chain anyway.
